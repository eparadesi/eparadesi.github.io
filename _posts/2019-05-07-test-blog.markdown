I just recently became a certified scrum master and decided that a unique application for my training is to use it with my kids at home! I have two boys a seven year old second grader and a five year old pre-kindergartener. It was becoming a struggle to get the boys ready for school on time and for them to remember everything they needed done. I decided that scrum would not only take advantage of what I had learned but also help the boys to take responsibility for getting themselves ready to go in the morning. Enjoy reading about
my struggles and success with using scrum at home!
